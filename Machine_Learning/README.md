# Machine Learning

The course was divided in 3 blocks:
1) Main practical concerns to deploy a ML model (introduction, about data, performance measures, ...)
2) ML theory (overfitting, optimization, regularization, ...)
3) ML famlies of models (linear models, ensembles, neural networks, unsupervised maniofold learning, dimentionality reduction, mixture models and clustering)

Each teoretical topic consisted of a notebook with theory, examples and exercises. At the end of the topic a small quiz was done.

The course was gradded by:
- One Kaggle competition on detecting 'Fake news' created by a LLM (done with @AlbaGarcia)
- A Workshop which consisted of a Peer-reviewed article (done with @JoelDieguez)
- 2 exams (4 pt in total)
